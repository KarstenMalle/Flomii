# Project Flomii

## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive collection of React components that are being designed and developed for a web application. It is being undertaken as a summer project with a focus on delivering reusable, highly customizable, and accessible components. 

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to construct a reliable set of reusable React components with broad compatibility and adaptability. Components are developed with meticulous care, maintaining the highest standards of coding and design practices. Each component is designed to be modular and reusable in various contexts within a web application.

## Technologies

This project is developed using a robust set of technologies, including:

- **React:** The library of choice for building user interfaces in JavaScript. 
- **Storybook:** An open-source tool that provides a sandbox to build and test UI components in isolation. 
- **Chromatic:** A powerful continuous integration tool that automates visual testing for Storybook. It helps catch visual changes, reducing the manual QA process.

## Methodology

The project is divided into several phases, each focusing on a specific set of components. Each component goes through a strict development and testing cycle to ensure it meets the expected functionality and accessibility standards. Storybook serves as the primary environment for developing and testing components, while Chromatic automates the visual testing process, ensuring a consistent look and feel across all components and their various states.

## Testing

Testing plays a crucial role in this project. Chromatic is used for automating visual regression tests. It helps catch unintended visual changes to components, ensuring the project's visual consistency.

## Future Enhancements

The future direction of this project includes:

- Adding more components to the library.
- Enhancing the existing components with additional features.
- Integrating more advanced testing tools and methodologies.
- Adapting to future trends and updates in React and associated technologies.
